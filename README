Scheme Infix Calculator

This project comes with the "it works on my machine" guarantee. Nothing else. I'd like to say it's released under the GPL, but I'm not sure exactly what that means. 

I'll just say, it's free to share, modify, manipulate, burn, whatever. If you see fit, credit me accordingly. If not, boo.

Work it by loading up "infix-calc.scm" and feeding it expressions like 

     (calc "3+4!*(3-40/2)")

The results should be less than surprising.
